# Car-Accidents

Just getting some more familiarity with answering questions about data that was given. I randomly looked for datasets and came across Car Accidents in the past year
I went through the data and came up with a question Are adverse weather conditions a key metric in car accidents? . But I got a pretty decent gist and will eventually come back to the same dataset to tyr some more intricate projects like predictions in the future. I left notes here and there of my process. So I am inclined to whatever feedback and advice given.
